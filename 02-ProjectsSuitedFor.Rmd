## Create resources for people working with spreadsheets in R

Here make a guide using github environments making a repo. Maybe a learnr tutorial?

Also put some code here:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(googlesheets4)
practice_sheet <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_zRBFrB1au7qhxuDDfDuh_bPLGd6RLrwOL5oQ3sBBX4/edit?usp=sharing", sheet = 'coinmetrics_btc_eth')
```

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(practice_sheet,  style = "default", 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, pageLength=5,dom='t'), rownames = F)
```

**This data is sourced from the website [coinmetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io/community-network-data/#comm-files)**

They also provide a data dictionary to go along with the data, let's also read that in with `googlesheets4`:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_dictionary <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_zRBFrB1au7qhxuDDfDuh_bPLGd6RLrwOL5oQ3sBBX4/edit?usp=sharing",sheet = 'coinmetrics_data_dictionary')
```

```{r}
datatable(data_dictionary,  style = "default", 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, pageLength=2, searchHighlight = TRUE), rownames = F) %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 9, width='800px')
```



**I am comfortable writing packages in R as well as using testthat and showing code coverage for a repository. I attended the building tidy tools workshop working with Charlotte and Hadley at RStudio::conf 2020.** 



COULD MAKE THIS FIRST SECTION FROM GOOGLE SHEETS USING DATA ACTUALLY PREDICTING % CHANGE AND WHATNOT IF I LOAD THAT OTHER DATA INTO HERE. COULD THEN WORK ON NEXT SECTION WHILE MAKING PROGRESS ON BOTH INTERNSHIP AND RESEARCH PAPER!


## Build interactive learnr tutorials for tidymodels

Create parsnip model

```{r}
library(parsnip)
linear_reg() %>%              
  set_engine("glmnet") %>%             
  set_mode("regression")

# List of models to refer to: https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Models.html

xgboost_parsnip <- boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%             
  set_mode("regression")
```

<!-- Remember to create split -->

<!-- Train/fit the model -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- fit_data( -->
<!--   Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, # a formula -->
<!--   model = lm_spec,          # parsnip model -->
<!--   data = ames               # dataframe -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Use the trained model to make new predictions -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- predict(lm_fit, new_data = ames) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Calculate accuracy -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- rmse(price_pred, truth = price_truth, estimate = .pred) -->
<!-- ``` -->




## Build interactive learnr tutorials for Python using reticulate


Replace this with the Python one:

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- knitr::include_app("https://predictcrypto.shinyapps.io/R_Basics/") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Could make a very simple xgboost model maybe?

Could also show using Shrimpy API to pull latest data, manipulate in pandas and visualize

Mention experience/courses taken in Python and how it's never clicked with me very much but how I am taking a basic Python course in my Master's in Data Science and I am looking to take it as an opportunity to create a lot of content using reticulate.

```{r import_reticulate}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}

```
