## Create resources for people working with spreadsheets in R


What better way to show I am suited for a project than to give a hands-on example? See the code below for a use-case using `googlesheets4`[@R-googlesheets4]. 

First I will go ahead and import every package in the `tidyverse`[@R-tidyverse]:
```{r import_tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```


Next let's import the package and read a spreadsheet I made for this internship application, specifying the sheet called *coinmetrics_btc_eth* inside the function `read_sheet()`:

```{r mute_gargle_sheets_warning, echo=F}
options(gargle_quiet = TRUE)
```


```{r import_coinmetrics_btc_eth, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
spreadsheet_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_zRBFrB1au7qhxuDDfDuh_bPLGd6RLrwOL5oQ3sBBX4/edit?usp=sharing"
library(googlesheets4)
googlesheets_data <- read_sheet(spreadsheet_url, sheet = 'coinmetrics_btc_eth') %>% as.data.frame()
```

Let's take a peek at the `datatable()`[@R-DT]
```{r show_googlesheets_data}
library(DT)
datatable(googlesheets_data,  style = "default", 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, pageLength=5,dom='t'), rownames = F)
```

**This data is sourced from the website [coinmetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io/community-network-data/#comm-files)**

Coinmetrics also provides a data dictionary to go along with the data, let's also read that in and take a look:
```{r pull_data_dictionary, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_dictionary <- read_sheet(spreadsheet_url, sheet = 'coinmetrics_data_dictionary')
```

```{r show_data_dictionary}
datatable(data_dictionary,  style = "default", 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, pageLength=2, searchHighlight = TRUE), rownames = F) %>% 
  formatStyle(columns = 9, width='800px') # Figure out how to adjust description to take up space horizontally and not vertically
```


Using the data from coinmetrics, I will create a predictive model to forecast the percentage change in price over time in order to show that I would be a good fit for the first two projects listed.


First, I will import a package that I am making that is **still in development** `PredictCrypto`:

```{r library_predict_crypto}
library(PredictCrypto)
```
(this is an in-development tool that I will use for a research paper I am working on)

I attended the two day building tidy tools workshop working with Charlotte and Hadley at RStudio::conf 2020 and I am comfortable writing packages in R as well as using testthat and showing code coverage for a repository.

Here is the GitHub Pages environment associated with the repository: https://ries9112.github.io/PredictCrypto/

```{r show_github_pages, echo=F}
knitr::include_url("https://ries9112.github.io/PredictCrypto/")
```

I am going to convert the column names from ***CamelCase*** to ***snake_case*** using the `janitor`[@R-janitor] package because the functions in my package use snake_case and I want to avoid mixing the two:

```{r print_before_colnames, echo=F}
print('Before:')
colnames(googlesheets_data)
```

```{r janitor_clean_names, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(janitor)
googlesheets_data <- clean_names(googlesheets_data)
```

```{r print_after_colnames, echo=F}
print('After:')
colnames(googlesheets_data)
```


Now that I imported the `PredictCrypto` package and the data is in snake_case, I can use the function `calculate_percent_change()` to create the target variable to predict. Before I can do that however, I need one more adjustment to the date/time fields, so let's do that using the `anytime`[@R-anytime] package:

```{r conversions_anytime}
library(anytime)
googlesheets_data$date <- anytime(googlesheets_data$date)
googlesheets_data$date_time_utc <- anytime(googlesheets_data$date_time_utc)
```


Now I can use the function `calculate_percent_change()` to calculate the % change of the price of each cryptocurrency and add a new column ***target_percent_change*** to each row, which will represent the percentage change in price for the 7 day period that came after that data point was collected:
```{r calculate_percent_change_function, warning=FALSE}
exercise_data <- PredictCrypto::calculate_percent_change(googlesheets_data, 7, 'days')
```

Let's take a peek at the new field:
```{r}
head(exercise_data$target_percent_change, 10)
```

I could easily change this to a 14 day period:

```{r target_14d}
calculate_percent_change(googlesheets_data, 14, 'days') %>% head(10) %>% select(target_percent_change)
```

Or a 24 hour period:

```{r target_24h}
calculate_percent_change(googlesheets_data, 24, 'hours') %>% head(10) %>% select(target_percent_change)
```





## Build interactive learnr tutorials for tidymodels

https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/conf20-intro-ml/

https://conf20-intro-ml.netlify.com/materials/01-predicting/

***Disclaimer***:**Most of the code to follow was built using the content made available by Allison Hill from the RStudio::conf2020 intro to machine learning workshop and was not code I was familiar with before writing it for this internship application.**

Create parsnip[@R-parsnip] model

```{r parsnip models}
library(parsnip)
linear_reg() %>%              
  set_engine("glmnet") %>%             
  set_mode("regression")

# List of models to refer to: https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Models.html
xgboost_parsnip <- boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%             
  set_mode("regression")
```

<!-- Remember to create split -->

<!-- Train/fit the model -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- fit_data( -->
<!--   Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, # a formula -->
<!--   model = lm_spec,          # parsnip model -->
<!--   data = ames               # dataframe -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Use the trained model to make new predictions -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- predict(lm_fit, new_data = ames) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Calculate accuracy -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- rmse(price_pred, truth = price_truth, estimate = .pred) -->
<!-- ``` -->




## Build interactive learnr tutorials for Python using reticulate

I also think I could be a great fit for the third project listed related to creating learnr tutorials for Python using reticulate. I have a fair amount of experience in Python, but it's never really clicked very much for as much as R in the past, and I am looking to step-up my Python skills. My Master's in Data Science will work with Python a lot, and people immediately ask if I make tutorials in Python when I show them the R tutorials I have made, so **this one would be my preferred project to work on.** I am also constantly told that Python is better than R for the incorrect reasons, and being more of an expert in Python would certainly help me debunk that myth when someone makes that argument.

I am very familiar with the `reticulate` package and I have used it in the past in an RMarkdown file to make automated cryptocurrency trades through a Python package `shrimpy-python`, which worked really well: https://github.com/shrimpy-dev/shrimpy-python

Since I have already demonstrated my familiarity with learnr tutorials **[in the previous section](#learnr)**, I will keep going with the code from the tidymodels project example I just finished and use Python for ... ADD GOAL HERE ...




DEV:

Replace this with the Python one:

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- knitr::include_app("https://predictcrypto.shinyapps.io/R_Basics/") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Could make a very simple xgboost model maybe?

Could also show using Shrimpy API to pull latest data, manipulate in pandas and visualize

Mention experience/courses taken in Python and how it's never clicked with me very much but how I am taking a basic Python course in my Master's in Data Science and I am looking to take it as an opportunity to create a lot of content using reticulate.

```{r import_reticulate}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}

```
